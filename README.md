===========

Skeleton for a Single Page Application using Angular &amp; Gulp

This project supplies a basic setup for working with Gulp (http://gulpjs.com/) and AngularJS (https://angularjs.org/)


### installation ###

install node (http://nodejs.org/) <br/>
clone or download this repository
  
Open a console at the project root and install all node-modules :

```ShellSession
	npm install
```
Install Gulp globally
```ShellSession
	npm install -g gulp
```

Do a initial build

```ShellSession
	gulp build
```

This will do minification on all images, compile Sass, minify javascript and create sourcemaps and copy all (including fonts) to the dist directory. It will also run the 'deps' task that installs the Bower dependencies. These are needed for the 'scripts'.'scripts-vendor' task.

### Run ###
There are actually 3 ways to run the skeleton

* copy it to a existing webserver
* run with browser-sync (http://www.browsersync.io/)
```ShellSession
	gulp browser-sync
```
This will open a browser for you. Point multiple browsers / devices to the same url and watch the magic happen.

* run in Express (http://expressjs.com/). 
```ShellSession
	gulp express
```
  optionally with Live-Reload (http://livereload.com/) 
 ```ShellSession
	gulp express-lr
```
Point your browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)


### Workflow ###

A basic workflow would be

 ```ShellSession
  // build all sources, creating the dist directory
  gulp build

  // launch a server against the dist folder and watch for changes in source file
  gulp browser-sync
```

### Gulp Tasks ###

The `gulpfile.js` contains several targets to make development easier.

Target         | Description
---------------|--------------------
browser-sync   | browser-sync task for starting a server. This will open a browser for you. Point multiple browsers / devices to the same url and watch the magic happen.Depends on: watch
build          | Build and copy all styles, scripts, images and fonts. Depends on: clean, deps
clean          | Cleans the `dist` folder and other generated files
copy           | Copies all to dist/
default        | Default task. Depends on: build
docs           | Generate docs from all application javascript
express        | Task to start a Express server on port 4000
express-lr     | Task to start a Express server on port 4000 and used the live reload functionality. Depends on: express, live-reload
images         | Task to optimize and deploy all images found in folder `src/img/**`. Result is copied to `dist/assets/img`
live-reload    | Start the live reload server. Live reload will be triggered when a file in the `dist` folder or the index.html changes. This will add a live-reload script to the page, which makes it all happen. Depends on: watch
scripts        | Task to handle and deploy all javascript, application & vendor. Depends on: scripts-app, scripts-vendor
scripts-app    | Minifies all javascript found in the `src/js/**` folder. All files will be concatenated into `app.js`.  Minified and non-minified versions are copied to the dist folder. This will also generete sourcemaps for the minified version. Depends on: docs
deps           | Runs the bower install command to dowload the client dependencies.
scripts-vendor | Task to handle all vendor specific javasript. All vendor javascript will be copied to the dist directory. Also a concatinated version will be made, available in \dist\assets\js\vendor\vendor.js
styles         | Compile Sass into Css and minify it. Minified and non-minified versions are copied to the dist folder. This will also auto prefix vendor specific rules.
todo           | Output TODO's & FIXME's in markdown and json file as well
watch          | Watches changes to Sass, javascript and images. On change this will run the appropriate task, either: styles, scripts or images.
